## Food Saver Hub

## Inspiration
We were inspired by Tesla STEM High School's inability to reduce food waste at schools. We have a robust Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Design class that does their best, but we keep seeing trash being sorted wrong and general confusion around food waste and composting that we wanted to combat.

## What it does
Our project consists of **three things**:
- _A game_ to help people test their knowledge of composting
- _A short quiz_ that helps students gain general knowledge relating to food consumption and waste
- _A pledge_ which allows people to set goals for themselves relating to food waste and consumption
- _A food voting page_ that allows people to vote for their favorite foods, which can be used by school cafeterias to make meals that more students like

## How we built it
We divided the project into 4 parts amongst ourselves based on our prior coding experience. Those who were well - versed in Python and Python graphics made the game and the quiz. Those who were more versed in JavaScript and CSS worked on the website and the pledge tracker.
We primarily used GitHub to collaborate and share code, and also used AI to improve and smooth out the
finer details of the project.

## Challenges we ran into
One of our team members nearly lost the finalized version of the website. He couldn't open the link in his browser and had to redo certain parts of the code to fix the problem.
Another challenge we ran into was AI prompting. The AI didn't always make the changes we wanted it to implement or do what we asked it to do. Figuring out how to work around that was a definite learning experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to figure out how to embed our game and quiz into the website through HTML. We also embedded it into our final presentation.
The design of the website itself is pretty sleek and modern, way better than anything we've done in the past.
Additionally, we all worked really well together as a team and collaborated effectively.

## What we learned
We learned how to embed games and quizzes into a website
We learned how to effectively use AI to simplify our project and add certain functionalities.

## What's next for FoodSaver Hub
Transform it into a mobile app.
Add weekly reminders for voting and following your pledge.
Add a photo grid or a tab with photos about people who've used the site to follow their pledge and support sustainability endeavors.
Connecting the app to social media accounts. 
Allow schools to use it to improve their food waste and carbon footprint.
